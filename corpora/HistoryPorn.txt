It always makes me sad when parents outlive their sons or daughters. It just isn't right... More images:

 I thought you must have meant World War 2 because if he's 86 now, he wasn't even born when WW1 took place, but then I read 1982. Still, he was only 18 then. Can't imagine what he's been through. 
Heartbreaking photographs.  Ironically, to this day there's still no national World War I memorial.

EDIT: I'm glad to hear it, guys! I remember the last WW1 vet, Frank Buckles, campaigning for a monument, but I guess he just wanted a national one in D.C.. ###**[There is a national WWI memorial. It was dedicated in 1926. It's just not in DC.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=liberty+memorial&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAH2SQUhUQRjHn7i76KRpI69sM9w22dTYnllGLPWsQwepmydPw_h29r2peTOPmXm-zGsRRCRGpy5CRHXoWseILtIhsIQuRlQntaCgDoEQPXeNJoKdy3zM9_v_Z75vPmtuZWnNslrttsynlvncju71n-978tdytx-_fNvyKwvAZCCSc1xTPQu_ZkFuO-wCnfl2J3RGjvFRVRu08q-ycBAccDzBGPE0FdyZJji-XMZSK6S0jD0dS6LsjWU6Do-AQyZJ_NlIU8yRJDN0BjOTr5zJjMOzoGLyHG9tKSeJT5UmEokaCtJISOqhiGGPKMSEV8eUPfVh04V50GNahLEicahsNPDDhSXQb-a0iGVqhrDWEnsNjxc3Vl3YB2yT-3vD64EFF-4Hu82sUcPyk3kXFsBeMx1JcTENUU14sbLvPCu4sB_0_mO_VVoVKapTi5uHd7pwCBRNQEgfc3ql_gaj3Pvy-2k4DA6aKFYqdcNcpy0LKa8SqRzMmG2lCx4HZZO9xEXCSNUnKMKcMFWvk9X_hiR4mpGGqgxKTVUBVigKBN_GTwCnKf5_0xu6k-BoU50KRMyqKCQyPUuoDhCL68reN09XN2_BIujcN3F-jz00ubg0DNsfjoyWTn17fn0XGnv3aOPjhYWK_WeaCklCCyEJ0yHCrJhps7pbO-76Y_euflErc4vrUx2fy30T6kHXb2eXhnQyAwAA)** Not only that, but we repurposed Armistice Day into a general veterans holiday. It is really weird how little acknowledgment the first world war receives in the US, especially considering its importance to the history of the US.

I know it lacks the heroic narrative that has been pushed with WW2, but it still marks the emergence of the US as a world power and is a very important event in US history. Don't think people realize it's significance since WW2 gets so much attention. WW1 is more understood and revered in Europe.  Well the USA was a player in WWI but didn't go through a crucible like the rest of Europe went through.  I think we're getting close to the problem. Our involvement in the Great War was brief. We didn't experience the initial insane casualties, where the French were losing more soldiers in a day than we did in the entire Vietnam War. But taking the world history view, the first world war was the most trans-formative and ugliest fighting of the 20th Century.  Isn't Bolsheviks more accurate? To the point that "Soviets" is literally wrong.
