Oh yeah? Well then lets see it do all that when it takes its suit off. I always instantly think of a Volus from Mass Effect whenever I see this image.
http://masseffected.pbworks.com/f/Volus.jpg Step 1: gather a large amount of these water bears

Step 2: allow only the largest water bears to mate in order to make larger offspring via artificial selection.

Step 3: repeat step 2 until the water bears are the size of regular bears.

Step 4: send some of your water bears to an impoverished country as a new livestock/food source

Step 5: repeat step 4 until you end world hunger.

Step 6: colonize space with the water bears

Step 7: enjoy your fame as you dig into a medium rare water bear steak
 Step 8: be conquered by a new race of nearly indestructible giant water bears. 

Step 9: welcome our new tardigrade lords &gt;vacuum of outer space 

I think this is because this things as a vacuum on it's face. The vacuums cancel each other out so the creature can survive quite easily.  The tree actually died in 2012, and the "tree" that now stands in the location is, in reality, a re-created sculpture that acts as a memorial to the tsunami's victims.

It barely made it, and had to be temporarily moved to a protected garden to be restored back to health. It was struck by lightening and then restored again. It stands healthy today in its original spot. Struck by lightning after surviving 9/11? Talk about bad luck tree...
