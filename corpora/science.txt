This is the kind of cancer-related news I get excited about. All the miracle cures that get posted weekly are great for the fraction of a percent of the population for which they'll be effective, but the real victory won't come until we have a much deeper understanding of the problem. These findings seem like a pretty significant step in that direction. Just so people don't mistakenly think we've found a magic bullet here: This research is only relevant to ~3% of cancers 3% of cancer types, or 3% of cancer cases? These situations are very rare.  I had a super high grade lymphoma that behaved like Burkitt's but the actual cancer was driven by a massive duplicated 11th chromosome in my B cells.

EDIT: also it was a somatic mutation.  My other cells are chromosomal normal. [deleted] Hooray for advent of next-generation genomic sequencing and mathematical modelling! I can't imagine any 5 year-old who would understand that &gt;"And it is possible that the small orbitofrontal cortex observed in marijuana users predated their marijuana use," says Phillip. "A 2012 study found that smaller orbital frontal cortex volume at 12 years of age appeared to predict the initiation of marijuana use later in life.”

This is pretty important. It makes sense that someone whose brain doesn't reward them as much would be more likely to seek pleasure-inducing drugs. The last paragraph of this article pretty much sums it up.... Yet another inconclusive study with multiple flaws and holes. Im all for continueing to research its long term effects but articles like these don't help the public, especially now if we want to get marijuana legalized finally. Disagree. Articles like these are necessary. In a world of bad science journalism that projects results into inconclusive studies, we need more of these journalists who provide context and tell readers what a study does *not* say.  Ok, is it safe to swim in the Pacific? Yes
I certainly do when I get a chance

Now for the more nerdy answer-
I tried to calculate the dose for swimming in the Pacific Ocean if there were 10 Becquerels per cubic meter of cesium 134 or 137 (and the highest number we reported today was 8 Bq/m3, 100 miles off Eureka).  So if swimming 6 hours/day, 365 days a year, that dose is less than 0.01 micro Sieverts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert.  Sorry for this new unit of dose, but to get from how much cesium is in the water to what this level means to human exposure, you need to look at dose conversions (not my specialty).  In any case it’s a small number, more than 1000 times less than a single dental xray.  It will not deter me from swimming in the Pacific.

0.1 micro Sieverts is about the radiation dose you get from eating a banana!  ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose) [deleted] Hey I'm no mathemagician  I guarantee you that swimming in the ocean isn't safe, but radiation exposure is likely to be the least of the hazards you would encounter there. You're more likely to be eaten by a shark than you are to die of radiation poisoning. And shark attacks are very rare; you're more likely to be held at gunpoint by a pirate. And pirates are easily avoided, unlike jellyfish. Get out of the water if you encounter a bunch of jellyfish near you. But the jellyfish stings can be treated, unlike the currents. Powerful currents are the most likely method that the ocean will use to kill you. 

TL;DR:  currents&gt;jellyfish&gt;pirates&gt;sharks&gt;nuclear fallout.  So how badly has the disaster affected sea life along the Japanese coast? Has your research changed your opinion on nuclear energy, one way or another?

In response to the Fukishima disaster, one of the most widely circulated pieces of information was [this image](http://farganne.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/fukushima-contamination-pacific-ocean-450x253.jpg?w=474), purportedly showing 'radioactive spread over the ocean', but in fact showing wave height radiating from the earthquake.

How do you feel misinformation has affected your research, and particularly, what misinformation are you interested in clearing up here? Is it safe to eat fish, crab, etc? Do you have any corporate associations, or associations with lobbyists or public affairs / public relations? OurRadioactiveOcean.org is a crowd funded citizen scientist campaign.
